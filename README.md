# CPNT-262 / Achievement 8 - Async Fetch Nuxt / Bryan Velasco

## Attributions

- X Content from a public rest api is visible and accessible
- X Deployed repo to netlify

---

## Process

- Earlier in the week, we had covered the async fetch methods for fetching APIs and we did it with the Disney API. I followed along with Ashlyn as she was showing us on `sfc.vuejs.org` how to fetch the API.

- I, then downloaded what I had done and added it to a Vue Project.

- Today, while trying to port over the content I was having some issues with the code not working.

- After trying to render it with different methods I went back to Monday's video and re-watched it. In it, `v-for` was used. So I decided to give that a try.

- Fortunately it worked and I was able to render the character names.

- I am going to try to see if I am able to also render the image.

- Added images. Was wrapping the image `src` like now I did the name. Turns out I did not need mustach syntax to pass the informantion to the `src` and `alt` text.

- Not finished just yet... Still have to deploy it as a netlify page

- Netlify Deployment was a success!

- Sorry for the long scroll!
